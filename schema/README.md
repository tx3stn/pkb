# Schema

The documents in this directory define the [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/)
for the configuration and files generated by `pkb`.

You can annoate your config file with the `$schema` keyword for a better
editing experience (provided your editor integrates with JSON schema tooling).

e.g.:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tx3stn/pkb/main/schema/config.json",
  "directory": "/home/user",
  ...
}
```

Changes to the schema should be validated through the `make schema-validate`
command to ensure they are correct.

## Examples

An [example file](./example.config.json) has been added to display what the
configuration should look like.
If you try editing it with an editor that supports JSON schemas you should see
the field names in your auto complete and the description of what each field is for.

This config file can be used to test out changes.
It is configured to use the templates and create files in the `testdata`
directory in the root of the repo.
